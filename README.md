### Background and Overview:

Sudoku is a popular number puzzle with 9 rows and 9 columns. The objective is to fill the 9 x 9 square with the numbers 1 through 9 in each row and column without any overlap. Additionally, the large 9 by 9 square is subsectioned into mini-3x3 squares that must also be uniquely filled with the numbers of 1 through 9. 

This project uses JavaScript to generate a modern Sudoku board with some prefilled boxes, allowing a user to fill the remaining spaces according to the rules of Sudoku.  

Potential Future Tweaks: 
- Allowing a user to choose difficulty level of the game, with varying level of prefilled spaces. 
- Add a 3rd dimension, maybe a 9 x 9 x 9 cube. (along with some nice visuals)

### Functionality and MVPs:

- Render an error when user makes an invalid move, and prevent the move from happening 
- Generate a score ( some function of time taken and number of invalid moves attempted)
